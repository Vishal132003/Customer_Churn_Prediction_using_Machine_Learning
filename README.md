# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a customer will leave a telecom service based on their usage patterns and demographics. It helps businesses identify customers at risk of churn and improve retention strategies.

## 📘 Overview
The goal is to analyze customer behavior and predict churn using various machine learning models.  
The dataset used is the [Telco Customer Churn Dataset]

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized customer trends and key churn factors.  
3. **Model Building** – Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.  
5. **Feature Importance** – Identified major drivers influencing churn.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 🏁 Results
- **Best Model:** XGBoost Classifier  
- **Performance:** Achieved the highest accuracy and ROC-AUC among all models.
